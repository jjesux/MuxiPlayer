This version was created using Android Studio on 12/5/2020.


This application has been tested only on android devices Huawei, ZTE 7.1.1,
LG 8.1, Motorola G Power 2021, and some android emulators. These emulators
were created using Android Studio 3.6.6.
So if this application is installed on different android devices it may run
well without crashing or it may do so. This is because, so far it accesses
only the SD Card, and the directory path is hard coded from the above device.
So the directory path may be different and the applicatioin would not read
any mp3 file.


In order to show, on the artist name tab. the mp3 file name belonging to an
artist, the following song file name format is needed:
.../singerName - songName.mp3
If this format is not used, then the song name may not appear on the artist
names list tab.

The last update makes the application runing on the ZTE device to stop or crash
when the applicatioin access the SD Card to read and update the databese holding
all the mp3 file names.

To fix: Maybe using a try-catch can fix the issue since all the other features
and functionalities run very well.


Update on 3/5/2022 - 3:10 pm, saturday in Watsonville.
The file SingerListFragTab.java on line 157 or so says that line causes an error
when this class is working.


Update on 3/3/2022 - 5:00 pm, thursday in Watsonville.
The random selection of mp3 files to play feature was coded/implemented. So far
it seems to me that it works fine. To activate this feature a long click on the
LOOP button is needed. One normal click will only activated the loop feature.
To turn it off a second long click or normal click is needed.


Update on 3/3/2022 - 5:00 pm, thursday in Watsonville.
The stop and loop buttons were synchronized. They were kind of synchronized. It
seems to me that those buttons are working ok.


Update on 12/3/2021 - 1:36 pm, friday in Watsonville.
The Manifest file was updated. This update was needed so the application could
access the SD Card, on the Motorola G Power, without implementing the new way
Android required to access the SD Card.

android:requestLegacyEternalStorage was added to the file.

To do: I think that showing users a UI so they can select in which directory the
mp3 files are located.



Update on 1/27/2021 - 7:20 pm, in Irapuato.
Some UI features of the equalizer were fixed. They did not worked correctly.
Some changes were make on the radio UI.


To do: I need to research how to accesss SD Card in a general way. So far the
SD Card path is hard coded for the devices discribed above.


To do: how to merge the functionality of the play and pause buttons.  It is like
when the button is clicked change that button text to pause as well as its
functionality.


To do: how to make the name of the song playing blink on the list view showing
all the song names, and thus remove the text view showing the name of the song
that it is been playing.


To fix: When a song is selected on the libreia UI the row changes color, but I
think that is not working correctly. It does not cause the application to crash
or stop. I think it is just a synchronization issue.


To fix: Organize the files on the Value directory.


To do: rebuild or make the radio UI, or eliminate some buttons.


To fix: the ZTE phone does not show any Log message when connected to the
Android Studio running on my computer.
